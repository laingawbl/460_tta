# CSC460 Project 3

## Overview
This project builds off the TTA RTOS from Project 2, unless it is very bad; then we will use someone else's.

## Working on it
- Let's use feature branches and I guess I will be the approver of merges
- We can use the github builtin bugtracker
- Build the project using `./build.sh` and the tests using `./build_test.sh [test file]`
- By convention, refer to TTA tasks in capitals (LIGHTDRV, DEATHMON)

## TODOs
- Move the Proj2 tests to some `rtos_test/` file? How are we going to test the Proj3 stuff if it's sitting on a roomba?
